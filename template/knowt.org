** User Guide
*** Quickstart

   Make sure you have either Emacs or Docker installed.

   Clone the repository to install:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  git clone https://github.com/dustinlacewell/knowt.git ~/src/
#+END_SRC

   (optional) Add the =knowt/bin= directory to your =$PATH=

   Now execute the =knowt= script. Some starter-files will be placed in
   =~/.knowt= if there's nothing there yet.

   First-time startup may take a minute or two as packages are installed.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
> bin/knowt ~/src/knowt
Created template at ~/.knowt/knowt.org
Created template at ~/.knowt/init.org
#+END_SRC

*** What is Emacs

    Emacs is a text-editor.

    Why can it seem overwhelming? In principle, it is actually quite
    simple. There is a Buffer of text, with an active Major Mode and optional
    Minor Modes. A Mode is simply a mapping of keyboard Binds to script
    Functions. Those Functions in turn modify the Buffer. Basically a fancy
    notepad. Of course, unlike notepad, those script Functions can do anything!

    So by visiting a Buffer and pressing keyboard Binds we cause Functions to
    modify the Buffer.

    For example, when you press the "a" key, most modes will call
    =(insert-char "a")= which inserts the "a" character into the Buffer at the
    Point. Pressing "control" and "p" at the same time calls =(previous-line)=
    and so on.

    You should stop here and do the [[elisp:(help-with-tutorial)][Tutorial]].

*** What is Org-Mode?

    Org-mode is a Major Mode for Emacs.

    It provides functionality for super-charging a plain-text document into a
    capable organizational and task tracking tool.

    Org-mode documents are organized into a tree of Headings which are denoted
    with a number of asterisks. This document is full of them!

    There are many more features of course - far far too many to cover
    here. But a helpful directory has been compiled to get you started learning
    all of the features:

*** So what is Knowt?

    Knowt is Emacs pre-configured for Org-mode!

    It stores all of your information in =~/.knowt=. On first-run, it will
    create the following things if they don't already exist:

    - =knowt.org= Org-mode file which contains all your data (this file!)

    - =init.org= Emacs customization file

    - =.emacs.d/= Folder to hold installed packages

    In general, you will only need to worry about =knowt.org= unless you are
    interested in creating your own elisp customizations.

*** What's it like?

    Knowt does not drastically change the core Org-mode experience. It simply
    provides some baked configuration which provides a nice foundation for
    using it.

    So what's provided?

    - Speedkeys

      There is a very useful built-in feature for Org-mode called "Speedkeys"
      which is disabled by default. It allows you to invoke Org-mode commands
      with a single key when the Point is at the beginning of a Headline.

      Knowt enables the Speedkey feature.

      ([[*Document%20Navigation][Speedkey Binds]])

    - Structured Narrowing

      [[info:emacs#Narrowing][Narrowing]] is an Emacs feature where you hide all but a specific portion
      of a buffer. Widening the buffer restores it.

      Knowt improves this functionality by maintaining a stack or list of
      narrowing regions. Now instead of widening restoring the entire Buffer,
      it restores the previous narrow region.

    - TODO Pre-configured Capture Templates

** Next Steps

   - Track your work tasks
   - Track your personal goals
   - Maintain your personal projects
   - Keep a list of contacts
   - Journal things that happen to you
   - Remember the books and moves you've read
   - Import your bookmarks
   - Write a Thesis or some Fan-Fiction
   - Create links that run scripts
