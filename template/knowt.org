** What is Knowt

   Knowt is a tool for knowing what you know.

   Built upon the all-powerful [[https://orgmode.org/][Org-mode]] for Emacs it provides a personal
   knowledge-base in the form of a monolithic plain-text file.

   - Keep track of what you need to do
   - Quickly add and retrieve heirarchical data
   - Throw away your bookmark manager
   - Keep notes on acquiantances
   - Curate a quote database

   The possibilities are endless!

** What's it like?

   You maintain a single plain-text file =~/.knowt/knowt.org= in which you use
   typical org-mode headers to organize your data:

#+BEGIN_SRC org-mode
* Work
** Project A
*** TODO fix that one thing
*** DONE proof of concept
*** WAITING get that thing approved
** Project B
*** TODO what is it
    i don't even know
* Research
** Functional Programming
*** Monads
**** F# for fun and profit       :bm:
#+END_SRC

   Many people are familiar with Org-mode's basic outlining and todo
   features. Maybe even they've even used the table formatting features!
   Org-mode is so so much more. You can spend days learning about its agenda
   aggregation reporting - but! not many people do.

   Knowt tries to keep you in the document by instead leaning on the [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Narrowing.html][Narrowing]]
   and [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/eintr/Narrowing-advantages.html#Narrowing-advantages][Widening]] features of Emacs. With a bit of elisp, a number of quick
   shortcut bindings are provided for searching and narrowing the view of the
   document to just what is of interest. Of course, it is just as easy to then
   restore the whole document.

   By jumping around the document using powerful searches, you can organize a
   ton of data however you want without losing track or suffering the headache
   of multiple files sprawled about. Everything you know in one version
   controlled placed. :)

** Quickstart

   First, make sure you have either Emacs or Docker installed.

   Just clone the repository to install:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  git clone https://github.com/dustinlacewell/knowt.git ~/src/
#+END_SRC

   Now execute the script. On startup some templates will be placed in
   =~/.knowt= if there's nothing there yet.

   A single argument is required, the path of the Knowt repository:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
> bin/knowt $PWD
Created template at ~/.knowt/knowt.org
Created template at ~/.knowt/.emacs.d/init.org
#+END_SRC

   - *knowt.org* : a starter knowt file to get you going
   - *init.org* : some nice starter emacs customizations

   Emacs should have opened up and you should be looking at this document!
